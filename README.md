These are my inputs and solutions to the 2020 advent of code problems as well as
a template that I used at the start of every day and some split functions I used
for spliting the input on given delimeters. All of the code is written in c++11.\

I didn't think about saving my solutions until day 10 so days 1-9 are missing and
I don't feel like going back and resolving them.
